#' Independent LD blocks
#'
#' Split a correlation matrix in blocks as independent as possible.
#' This will find the splitting in blocks that minimize the sum of squared
#' correlation between these blocks (i.e. everything outside these blocks).
#'
#' @param corr Sparse correlation matrix. Usually, the output of [snp_cor()].
#' @param thr_r2 Threshold under which squared correlations are ignored.
#'   This is useful to avoid counting noise, which should give clearer patterns
#'   of costs vs. number of blocks. It is therefore possible to have a splitting
#'   cost of 0. If this parameter is used, then `corr` can be computed using the
#'   same parameter in [snp_cor()] (to increase the sparsity of the resulting matrix).
#' @param min_size Minimum number of variants in each block. This is used not to
#'   have a disproportionate number of small blocks.
#' @param max_size Maximum number of variants in each block. This is used not to
#'   have blocks that are too large, e.g. to limit computational and memory
#'   requirements of applications that would use these blocks. For some long-range
#'   LD regions, it may be needed to allow for large blocks.
#' @param max_K Maximum number of blocks to consider. All optimal solutions for K
#'   from 1 to `max_K` will be returned. Some of these K might not have any corresponding
#'   solution due to the limitations in size of the blocks. For example, splitting
#'   10,000 variants in blocks with at least 500 and at most 2000 variants implies
#'   that there are at least 5 and at most 20 blocks. Then, the choice of K depends
#'   on the application, but a simple solution is to choose the largest K for which
#'   the cost is lower than some threshold.
#'
#' @return A tibble with five columns:
#'   - `$n_block`: Number of blocks.
#'   - `$cost`: The sum of squared correlations outside the blocks.
#'   - `$perc_kept`: Percentage of initial non-zero values kept within the blocks defined.
#'   - `$block_num`: Resulting block numbers for each variant.
#'   - `$all_last`: Last index of each block.
#'   - `$all_size`: Sizes of the blocks.
